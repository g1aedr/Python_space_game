# Python_space_game
School project for Python course 

To start the simulation, open a terminal and run python main.py. This will launch the game window and start the FastAPI server. If you'd like to test the dummy agent (an automated ship that plays using the API), open a second terminal and run python dummy_agent.py. You can also interact with the API manually or inspect live data (such as position, angle, and nearby enemies) by visiting http://127.0.0.1:8000/docs in your browser.
