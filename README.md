# Python_space_game
School project for Python course 

Download the game in the ZIP file (the later version, the better :D), to start the simulation, open a terminal and run python main.py (also need to be in a correct folder). This will launch the game window and start the FastAPI server. If you'd like to test the dummy agent, open a second terminal and run python dummy_agent.py. You can also interact with the API manually or inspect live data by visiting http://127.0.0.1:8000/docs in your browser.
